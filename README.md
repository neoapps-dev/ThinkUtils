### 🌀 Fan Control
Take control of your ThinkPad's legendary cooling system. Whether you need whisper-quiet operation in a library or maximum cooling for intensive workloads, ThinkUtils gives you precise control.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch CPU/GPU temperatures and fan RPM update live—know exactly what's happening inside your machine
- **Multiple Control Modes**:
  - **Auto Mode**: Let the system intelligently manage cooling based on temperature (recommended for most users)
  - **Manual Mode**: Set precise fan speed levels from 0 (silent) to 7 (maximum)—perfect for finding the sweet spot between noise and cooling
  - **Maximum Mode**: Run fans at full blast for intensive tasks like video rendering or gaming
- **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor every thermal sensor in your system—CPU cores, GPU, battery, and more
- **Permission Management**: Secure, one-time elevated access using pkexec—no need to run the entire app as root

### 🔋 Battery Management
Extend your battery's lifespan by years with intelligent charge management. ThinkUtils helps you implement the 40-80 rule that professionals use to maximize battery longevity.

- **Responsive Design**: Clean, organized layout that makes complex system controls feel intuitive and accessible
- **Real-time Updates**: All metrics refresh automatically—no manual refreshing needed

## How it Works

ThinkUtils combines the performance of Rust with the flexibility of web technologies to deliver a native desktop experience:

- **Rust backend** provides blazing-fast system access and direct hardware control with minimal overhead
- **sensors command** (lm-sensors) reads temperature data from all available thermal sensors
- **/proc/acpi/ibm/fan** interface gives direct access to ThinkPad's fan controller via the thinkpad_acpi kernel module
- **pkexec** handles elevated permissions securely—only specific operations require root access, not the entire application

## Prerequisites

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install lm-sensors policykit-1
```

### Fedora / RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install lm_sensors polkit
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S lm_sensors polkit
```

## Setup ThinkPad Fan Control

Before using ThinkUtils, you need to enable fan control:

1. Create or edit the thinkpad_acpi configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf
```

2. Add this line:
```
options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1
```

3. Reboot your system or reload the module:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r thinkpad_acpi
sudo modprobe thinkpad_acpi
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust (1.70 or later)
- Node.js and npm
- Development dependencies for your distribution

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libssl-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libappindicator-gtk3-devel \
    librsvg2-devel
```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vietanhdev/ThinkUtils.git
cd thinkutils
npm install
```

2. **Run in development mode:**
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

3. **Build for production:**
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The built packages will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

### Code Quality & Linting

ThinkUtils uses comprehensive linting and formatting tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint** - JavaScript linting
- **HTMLHint** - HTML validation
- **Stylelint** - CSS linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **lint-staged** - Run linters on staged files only

#### Available Commands

```bash
# Run all linters
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format all files
npm run format

# Full validation (lint + format check)
npm run validate
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are automatically set up when you run `npm install`. They will:

1. ✅ **Auto-format** staged files (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON)
2. ✅ **Lint** staged files and fix auto-fixable issues
3. ✅ **Validate** all code before allowing commit
4. ❌ **Block commit** if linting fails

**What happens on commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "Your message"

🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
📝 Formatting and linting staged files...
  ✓ JavaScript files formatted and linted
  ✓ CSS files formatted and linted
  ✓ HTML files validated
✅ All checks passed!
```

**If issues are found:**
```bash
❌ Linting failed. Please fix the issues and try again.
```

The commit will be blocked until you fix the issues. Most issues can be auto-fixed:
```bash
npm run lint:fix
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

#### IDE Integration

**VS Code** (Recommended):
1. Install recommended extensions (popup will appear)
2. Reload VS Code
3. Files will auto-format on save!

Recommended extensions:
- ESLint
- Prettier
- HTMLHint
- Stylelint

**Other IDEs:**
See `LINTING_SETUP.md` for configuration instructions.

#### Bypassing Pre-commit Hooks

In rare cases where you need to bypass hooks (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"
```

2. Authorize ThinkUtils to access Google Drive
3. Use **Sync Now** to backup current settings
4. Use **Download Settings** to restore from cloud

**Note**: Requires Google OAuth credentials configured in source code.

### Permissions

ThinkUtils may request elevated permissions for:
- Fan control access
- Battery threshold configuration
- CPU governor changes
- Power profile management

All requests are handled securely using `pkexec`.

## Compatibility

ThinkUtils is designed for IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad laptops running Linux.

**Tested on:**
- ThinkPad T480, T490, T14
- ThinkPad X1 Carbon (various generations)
- ThinkPad P-series workstations

**Requirements:**
- Linux kernel with thinkpad_acpi module
- /proc/acpi/ibm/fan interface available

## Troubleshooting

### Fan control not working
1. Verify thinkpad_acpi is loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep thinkpad_acpi
   ```
2. Check if fan control is enabled:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf
   ```
3. Verify the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -l /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
   ```

### Permission errors
ThinkUtils will automatically request elevated permissions. If issues persist:
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
```

Note: This needs to be done after each reboot unless you set up udev rules.

### No temperature data
Ensure lm-sensors is installed and configured:
```bash
sudo sensors-detect
sensors
```
