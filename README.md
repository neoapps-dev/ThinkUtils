## How it Works

ThinkUtils combines the performance of Rust with the flexibility of web technologies to deliver a native desktop experience:

- **Rust backend** provides blazing-fast system access and direct hardware control with minimal overhead
- **sensors command** (lm-sensors) reads temperature data from all available thermal sensors
- **/proc/acpi/ibm/fan** interface gives direct access to ThinkPad's fan controller via the thinkpad_acpi kernel module
- **pkexec** handles elevated permissions securely—only specific operations require root access, not the entire application

## Prerequisites

### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install lm-sensors policykit-1
```

### Fedora / RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install lm_sensors polkit
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S lm_sensors polkit
```

## Setup ThinkPad Fan Control

Before using ThinkUtils, you need to enable fan control:

1. Create or edit the thinkpad_acpi configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf
```

2. Add this line:
```
options thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1
```

3. Reboot your system or reload the module:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r thinkpad_acpi
sudo modprobe thinkpad_acpi
```

## Development

## Compatibility

ThinkUtils is designed for IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad laptops running Linux.

**Tested on:**
- ThinkPad T480, T490, T14
- ThinkPad X1 Carbon (various generations)
- ThinkPad P-series workstations

**Requirements:**
- Linux kernel with thinkpad_acpi module
- /proc/acpi/ibm/fan interface available

## Troubleshooting

### Fan control not working
1. Verify thinkpad_acpi is loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep thinkpad_acpi
   ```
2. Check if fan control is enabled:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/modprobe.d/thinkpad_acpi.conf
   ```
3. Verify the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -l /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
   ```

### Permission errors
ThinkUtils will automatically request elevated permissions. If issues persist:
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
```

Note: This needs to be done after each reboot unless you set up udev rules.

### No temperature data
Ensure lm-sensors is installed and configured:
```bash
sudo sensors-detect
sensors
```
